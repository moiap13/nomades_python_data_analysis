# Exercise serie - 0

Welcome to this prerequist week for the nomades `Python Data Analysis` class. 

For this first week's exercises, we'll see how `jupyter` works and the basis of python, including `variables`, `operators` and `print / input` functions.

## EX0

For this serie you'll have three exercise to produce:
  1. `print_input.ipynb`, in this jupyter file you'll be asked to print an input from the user. You will also be asked to concatenate string variables.
  2. `arithmetics.ipynb`, in this jupyter file you'll be asked to make some basic arithmetics operation, storing results inside `variables` and printing the result.
  3. for the last task, you are asked to create a jupyter file, called `sum_number.ipynb`. In this file you'll be asked to loop throught a list of number (`list`, `range`, `string`, whatever you want) and print the sum of these numbers.
   
## Some helps

- You can use the course materials (jupyters)

### Variable

A variable is a name that can be used to store a value. For example, you can store the result of an operation in a variable. You can use the variable in your code to perform the operation.

```python
x = 10
y = 20
z = x + y
```

Here, `x` and `y` are variables and `z` is a variable that stores the result of the operation.

### Operators

Operators are symbols that can be used to perform operations. For example, you can use the `+` operator to add two numbers.

| Operator | Description | usage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `+` | Add two numbers, or concatenate two strings | `x + y` |
| `-` | Subtract two numbers | `x - y` |
| `*` | Multiply two numbers | `x * y` |
| `/` | Divide two numbers | `x / y` |
| `**` | Exponentiate two numbers | `x ** y` |
| `%` | Modulus of two numbers | `x % y` |
| `//` | Floor division of two numbers | `x // y` |

### Print / Input

`print` and `input` are functions that can be used to print and input values. For example, you can use `print` to print a message and `input` to input a value.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
x = input("Enter a number: ")
```

Here, `print` and `input` are functions and `x` is a variable that stores the input value **as string type**.

### For loop

`for` loops are used to loop through a list of values. For example, you can use `for` loop to loop through a list of numbers and print each number.

```python
for i in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    print(i)
```

Here, `i` is a variable that stores the current value of the loop.
